Write this lab according to OpenGL Programming Guide, you can find the book in OPG/book. I also add the offcial source code as a submodule to this repo.

Q:How to build it?
A:In the root path, run :
$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake -G <your compiler> ..

Q:How about opengl lib?
A:My display card is RTX3060 and my driver verison is 531.79, which support opengl 4.6, you can check this info by using GPU-Z in the /Tools path.

Q:Why the directory structure got a big difference with the official example?
A:I don't understand why the OpenGL Red Book's example project provided on GitHub was designed in that way, so I made some adjustments. However, some weird questions still exist, such as why not simply make the whole Vermilion project into a library.

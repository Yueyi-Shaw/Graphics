src code about the book Cuda by Example.

pdf can be found in ./book

Env:
WSL2 + VScode + Cuda toolkit + glut + glext(gl libs are optional because I print my img to ppm files actually, it is a bit complicated to show a window or ui in wsl2)

or:
on windows: what you need is change cl.exe path in Makefile, and copy glut32/64.dll to outdir

sudo apt install freeglut3-dev libglew-dev to fetch cv libs
*You can install Cuda in wsl2 according to a tutorial provided by Nvidia. Also you may need to add cuda to path by editing .bashrc

1.In chapter 7, I found it takes more time to generate next frame by using texture memory, my graphics card is GTX1660 SUPER. My result as follow:
Global mem : 7.1ms
Texture : 9.7ms
Texture2D : 10.0ms

2."error: texture is not a template" for cuda 12.x

3.In chapter 8:
$ ./out/8.2.1.out
CUDA-capable device(s) is/are busy or unavailable in C:\Users\yix\Desktop\Graphics\proj\my labs\cudabyexample\src\8.2.1.cu at line 63
just Comment out:
    // cudaDeviceProp prop;
    // int dev;
    // memset(&prop, 0, sizeof(cudaDeviceProp));
    // prop.major = 1;
    // prop.minor = 0;
    // HANDLE_ERROR(cudaChooseDevice(&dev, &prop));
    // HANDLE_ERROR(cudaGLSetGLDevice(dev));

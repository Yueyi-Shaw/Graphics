src code about the book Cuda by Example.

pdf can be found in ./book

Env:
WSL2 + VScode + Cuda toolkit + glut + glext(gl libs are optional because I print my img to ppm files actually, it is a bit complicated to show a window or ui in wsl2)

sudo apt install freeglut3-dev libglew-dev to fetch cv libs
*You can install Cuda in wsl2 according to a tutorial provided by Nvidia. Also you may need to add cuda to path by editing .bashrc
